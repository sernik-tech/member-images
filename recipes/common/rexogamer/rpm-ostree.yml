    # This `repos` section is used for Copr repositories. You can find some over at the copr
    # homepage: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/

    # To add a copr repo, you need to add the repo file. For example, let's say this is a copr
    # repo you want to add:

    # https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/<username>/<project-name>/
    #
    # Append the following to the end:
    #
    # repo/fedora-%OS_VERSION%/<username>-<project-name>-rendezvous-fedora-%OS_VERSION%.repo
    #
    # And you should get something like this!
    #
    # https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/<username>/<project-name>/repo/fedora-%OS_VERSION%/<username>-<project-name>-rendezvous-fedora-%OS_VERSION%.repo
