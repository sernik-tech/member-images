# This recipe file is based on blue-build's default recipe file for Sericea images.
# We'll try our best to link to most documentation or explain certain modules.
# You'll find links back to their original documentation, which are mostly (if not all) found over at:
# https://blue-build.org/learn/getting-started/

# This recipe file is structured for multiple folders. All configurations done with modules in here
# are controlled/configured outside of this file and usually done in /common/. This is not necessary
# If you do not prefer this way. I'd (Sneexy) figured this would probably be the cleanest and also a
# nice collaborative way of making images, especially if anyone decides to team up with each other
# for making images(...?)

# If you'd just want to make this by yourself from scratch, or would prefer not to use our customized
# examples, please refer to the original repository at https://github.com/blue-build/template/
# and their documentation at https://blue-build.org/learn/getting-started/
#
# Their default examples are possibly more updated with information than ours, and also use a more
# "simpler" recipe where most of the module configuration is done within the file rather than
# externally sourcing the modules.

# Below is basic image metadata/information.
# Documentation: https://blue-build.org/reference/recipe/

# - Your image name -
# Change this to whatever image name you'd like. It cannot be an image that is used by another
# image that is being built/published.
# It will be found under ghcr.io/sernik-tech/<name>
name: moonstone-kinoite
# - Description -
# Will be included in the image's metadata, can be whatever.
description: gay cats meowmeowmeowmeowmeow

# - Base image -
# The base image to build on top of, and the (Fedora) version tag to use.
# You can see a full list of available images/bases here: https://universal-blue.org/images/#image-categorization
# Since this is Sericea based, we're using Sericea:
base-image: ghcr.io/ublue-os/kinoite-nvidia
# Replace above with `ghcr.io/ublue-os/sericea-nvidia` if you're using a device with Nvidia.
#
# Version number, related to the version of Fedora. `latest` is also supported if you
# want new updates as soon as possible.
image-version: 39

# - Modules -
# Module configurations, executed in order.
# You can include multiple instances of the same module.
# Documentation: https://blue-build.org/reference/module/
modules:
    # Modules here are sourced from files in `/common/amycatgirl` for this specific recipe. If you don't want to rely on
    # modules being outside of this recipe file, you can refer to the documentation (linked above) to see examples.
    # Alternatively, use the `recipe-all.yml` recipe instead of this one if you prefer that.

    # - Files -
    # Determines which files you want to add into the "root" (in heavy air quotes, because it's `/usr/`) of your image.
    # Documentation: https://blue-build.org/reference/modules/files/
  - from-file: common/amycatgirl/files.yml

    # - rpm-ostree -
    # Packages that should be installed on the image. Now, when choosing which packages to install, we recommend
    # that you don't attempt to just add everything. Preferably, use anything else (e.g VSCode) inside of distrobox
    # or use flatpaks whenever possible (both preincluded) as alternatives to installing them. Also take note that
    # packages that attempt to create users or groups *will* cause issues when attempting to create your image, so
    # it's best to just layer them manually on your booted system afterwards if this is the case.
    # Documentation: https://blue-build.org/reference/modules/rpm-ostree/
  - from-file: common/amycatgirl/rpm-ostree.yml

    # Install Huion's tabler driver and uDev rules
  - type: script
    scripts:
        - huiondriver-setup.sh

    # - Flatpaks -
    # Flatpaks that will end up being installed out of the box on the system. Feel free to add anything here you'd
    # want to be inside of flatpaks on your system.
    # Documentation: https://blue-build.org/reference/modules/default-flatpaks/
  - from-file: common/amycatgirl/flatpaks.yml

    # - Fonts -
    # The fonts module allows you to easily install fonts from both Google Fonts and Nerd Fonts.
    # Documentation: https://blue-build.org/reference/modules/fonts/
  - from-file: common/amycatgirl/fonts.yml

    # - Bling -
  - from-file: common/amycatgirl/bling.yml

    # - Akmods -
    # Akmods are a neat thing provided by the blue-build people, they're basically easy-to-install kernel modules.
    # Documentation: https://blue-build.org/reference/modules/akmods/
    #
    # Uncomment below *after* modifying the akmods config as all modules are commented by default.
    # - from-file: common/amycatgirl/akmods.yml

    # this sets up the proper policy & signing files for signed images to work fully.
    # in *all* cases, this line should NEVER be touched. leave it here as is. there is no need to modify or remove this.
    # Documentation: https://blue-build.org/reference/modules/signing/
  - type: signing

    # Note that not all modules are listed here. We only added some that are most utilized by most users, but there are a
    # lot more modules that can be utilized.
    # You can find extra modules documented here (this is the first entry of the "modules" list):
